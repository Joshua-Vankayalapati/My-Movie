### Project Development Guidelines

- The project will be delivered in four sprints, with each sprint delivering a minimal viable product.
- Proper sprint planning with user stories is mandatory.
- Choose technologies from the recommended list for different layers of the project.
- Ensure the web application is responsive, and data is fetched or sent dynamically without hardcoded values.
- Maintain the version of the application on GitHub with every new change.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
- Deploy and host the application on an AWS EC2 instance.
- Implement automation testing before the application enters the CI/CD pipeline.
- Use Git branching for basic automation testing separately.
- Create a rich frontend that is user-friendly and easy to navigate.
- The application will have two portals: Admin and User.

### Admin Portal

- Add or remove different genres to/from the application to build a rich product line.
- Edit movie details like name, ticket price, language, description, and show timings to align with current prices.
- Enable or disable movie shows from the application.

### User Portal

Deals with user activities. End-users should be able to:

- Sign in to the application to maintain a record of activities.
- Search for movie tickets based on search keywords.
- Apply filters and sort results based on different genres.
- Add selected movie tickets to a cart and customize the purchase.
- Experience a seamless payment process.
- Receive a booking summary page once the payment is complete.
